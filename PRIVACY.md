Privacy Policy for The Void

Last updated: September 11, 2025

The Void is a privacy-first application. Your privacy is sacred, and this app is designed so that no personal data is ever collected, stored, or shared.

Information Collection and Use

No data is collected. The Void does not store or transmit your audio, video, or sensor data.

No personal information is required. You do not need an account, login, or identifier to use the app.

Sensor Access

The Void temporarily accesses your device sensors only while you are in an active session:

Microphone: Used to measure volume and create real-time particle effects.

Camera: Used to detect ambient light and generate abstract visual shimmer.

Motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope): Used to shape particle motion and distortion.

Location (optional): Used only for abstract randomness in visuals, then immediately discarded.

All sensor input is consumed in real time, transformed into ephemeral visuals, and then discarded. Nothing is recorded or saved.

Data Storage and Sharing

No storage: The Void does not save data locally or in the cloud.

No sharing: The Void never shares information with third parties.

No analysis: No speech recognition, transcription, or tracking is performed.

No network: The app does not use the internet.

Session End

When you end a session, all sensor access stops immediately. No trace of your activity remains on your device.
